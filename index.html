        Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
And on his farm he had a cow, E-I-E-I-O
With a moo-moo here and a moo-moo there
Here a moo
There a moo
Everywhere moo-moo
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O

Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
And on his farm he had a pig, E-I-E-I-O
With an oink-oink here and an oink-oink there
Here an oink
There an oink
Everywhere oink-oink
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O

Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O

With a moo-moo here and a quack-quack there
Here a quack

Everywhere quack-quack
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O

    <h1>Coolio</h1>
    <p>As I walk through the farm of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's not much left
'Coz I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that
Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you're talkin', and where you're walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip but I gotta, loc
As I grow I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight
Been spendin' most their lives,
livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives,
livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives,
livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives,
livin' in the gangsta's paradise</p>

<p>I said the joker is a wanted man,
    He makes his way all across the land,
    See him sifting through the sand,
    So I'll tell you all the story,
    About the joker and the thief of the night,
    Always laughing in the midst of power,
    Always living in the final hour,
    There is always sweet in the sour,
    We are not goin' home,
    Can you see the joker flying over,
    As she's standing in the field of clover,
    Watching out everyday,
    I wonder what would happen is he took her away,
    What you see well you might not know,
    You get the feelin' comin' after the glow,
    The vagabond is moving slow,
    So I'll tell you all the story,
    'bout the joker and the thief of the night,
    All the people that he see in the night,
    Hold their dreams up to the light,
    The wild beast is searching for sight,
    We are not goin' home,
    Can you see the joker flying over,
    As she's standing in the field of clover,
    Watching out everyday,
    I wonder what would happen is he took her away,
    Tell you the story 'bout the the joker and the thief,
    I said, I'll tell you the story 'bout the the joker and the thief,
    I said, I'll tell you the story 'bout the the joker and the thief,
    Of the night</p>
