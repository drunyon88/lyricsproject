        Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
And on his farm he had a cow, E-I-E-I-O
With a moo-moo here and a moo-moo there
Here a moo
There a moo
Everywhere moo-moo
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O

Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
And on his farm he had a pig, E-I-E-I-O
With an oink-oink here and an oink-oink there
Here an oink
There an oink
Everywhere oink-oink
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O

Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
And on his farm he had a duck, E-I-E-I-O
With a moo-moo here and a quack-quack there
Here a quack
There a quack
Everywhere quack-quack
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O

Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
And on his farm he had a horse, E-I-E-I-O
With a neigh-neigh here and a neigh-neigh there

    <h1>Coolio</h1>
    <p>As I walk through the farm of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's not much left
'Coz I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that
Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you're talkin', and where you're walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip but I gotta, loc
As I grow I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight
Been spendin' most their lives,
livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives,
livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives,
livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives,
livin' in the gangsta's paradise</p>
